minimalMVC
==========

Another MVC framework in PHP.

A really minimal MVC framework with helpers and library support.

How to use?
-----------

- Check example in `app/` directory.
- Run phpDoc and understand available methods. (I have tried to make documentation phpDoc compatible, not sure with what level of success :P)
- Alternatively, browse the `sys/` directory and understand code (If you are a real coder :P)
- Add more controllers, models, views, libraries and helpers in app and make something awesome. :)

**Note: Sorry for the not so good documentation, but if you are *real coder* you can get everything from the code. It is nicely written. :P**

History
--------

I have some problems with big frameworks that does everything for me without me knowing what they are doing... Also, I have problems with using others libraries rather than writing myself (But sadly, I cannot write everything myself :/).

But this time they allowed me to create and use a framework for the website of our college fest ([Felicity 2k15, IIIT Hyderabad](http://felicity.iiit.ac.in/)). Thanks to my friends @polybuildr and @hharchani who allowed me to create a framework and use it rather than using *someone else's* framework. :D

This was created as part of the website mentioned above, and then I separated it as a different project. Old commits history is not preserved as some of them was specific to that project.
